Yesterday I have released the public testing version for my Modern Guns Datapack Remastered. Today, I would like to collect feedback on it. These feedbacks includes suggestions, bug reports, and complaints which would be useful for the development of the Datapack. I look forward to gathering all of your feedback on my **[Github Issue Pages](https://github.com/Type-32/Minecraft-Modern-Guns-Datapack-Remastered/issues)**!
