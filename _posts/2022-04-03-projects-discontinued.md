Hello and I am sorry to announce this sad message--I am discontinuing my Minecraft Modern Guns Datapack. This datapack was originally created to test out Minecraft Datapack's right-click detection ability and raycasting ability and since then until now, this datapack has gone far more than just a test. This Datapack had became a playable and somewhat enjoyable Guns Datapack, which I aim to add guns to the vanilla experience while not adding anything else overpowered. Since its creation back in 2021, I have had enough passion and creativity that would drive me into developing this datapack to the fullest, to that I mean by adding all the promised features that I have achieved for.

However, starting from March 2022, which is when my school has started online courses, I had realized that I now have much less time for developing my projects than I used to have compared to Winter and Summer Breaks, which in online course curriculums I had to work twice as hard on my school work to keep up and have better grades. Basically, I just need to focus more on my studies instead of my projects. This will probably be said the same for other projects since I am fully focusing on my studies right now and I have no time to manage and develop my other projects. But even with that said, the other projects are not discontinued(...yet?). I am only discontinuing my Minecraft Modern Guns Datapack because I had lost the passion and creativity to keep making Minecraft Datapacks, since that last time I touched a relative subject of it has been over 2 months. I would probably make other Minecraft Datapacks later on if I have enough time and energy and pure will to continue dabble in Minecraft Datapack Developing, but right now, I just needed to take a break away from entertainment.
