This is the official Remastered Modern Guns Datapack from the original. Back with support for more versions, new content, and more user-friendly and **developer-friendly** features! The Remastered Version of the original Modern Guns Datapack is aimed to mainly clean up the spaghetti code of the original version and to optimize and add more features to it. My aim is to make it **Usable**, **Customizable**, **Developable**, **Extendable**, and **Up-To-Date with Latest Minecraft Versions**.
