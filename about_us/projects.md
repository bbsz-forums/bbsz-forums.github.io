# My Projects

## Minecraft Related Stuff

I enjoy playing on Minecraft Java, but I also enjoy making stuff on Minecraft Java, which brings me to a position of a Minecraft Content Developer.

### [Minecraft Datapacks](https://type-32.github.io/projects/minecraft-datapacks)

I mainly work as the role of a **Minecraft Datapack Developer** when playing Minecraft. I have approximately 3 years of Minecraft Datapack Developing Experience and I utilize them to the fullest. I am able to make some quality Datapacks and can commission some personal ones for SMPs or public servers. You can contact me [here](https://type-32.github.io/about_us/contact-us) which will bring you to my Discord server link and also my YouTube Channel Link.

### [Minecraft Mods](https://type-32.github.io/projects/minecraft-mods)

I suboptimally work as the role of an amatuer **Minecraft Mod Developer** when playing Minecraft. I sometimes make my own mods and sometimes backport other older version mods into new versions. The Mod platform I mainly develop my mods on is Fabric. Fabric is a lightweighted Modloader that has, in contrast to other relatively older modloaders that had previously existed, a more beginner-easy modloader API to begin on. My personal prefernce is Fabric is mainly due to its modernness to its up-to-date recent Minecraft Versions and its fast speed on updating to Minecraft Snapshots.

## Game Developer

I enjoy playing games, as well as making them. I always wanted to make fabulous games and to play them myself, which is what have me motivated into studying Game Development. My game engine preference is [Unity](unity3d.com) because it is a relatively lightweight engine and also extremely customizable by users for their own needs on their projects. I have learned one year of game development and worked on unity for approximately 6 ~ 8 months.
